# ElevatorStateMachine
The Elevator State Machine Programming Test

Build an elevator simulator. It should have a UI that shows 5 floors, with the call buttons for each floor. The UI should also show the panel of buttons inside the elevator. As a user, I can press any floor call button (up or down), as well as elevator panel buttons to move the elevator. The elevator should move at a realistic speed (not just go instantaneously to the desired floor).

Evaluation criteria:

Accuracy of the elevator state machine with various button-press scenarios.
The object design of your project – how you organize the design into classes and their relationships, what design patterns you choose to use.
Coding style and clarity.
The UI doesn’t need to be fancy, but it needs to enable the functional requirements stated above. You can use any UI toolkit of your choice.
